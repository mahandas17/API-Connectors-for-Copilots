# API-Connectors-for-Copilots

We want to empower organizations to onboard their existing APIs into copilot platforms starting with Security Copilot. The faster the developers onboard their investigation specific APIs, the faster Analysts can engage with the platform and experience the power of Copilots. With this in mind, we provide tools to accelerate the plugin building capabilities as well as use it to build NL2API plugin that can create a user endpoint based on User Questions.
